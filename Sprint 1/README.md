## Day [1] - Scrum Meeting summary
The Scrum Master for this meeting was Vivien Prakash

### Members Present:
Vivien, Justas, Dominic, Gerard, Abdulmalik, Brenyn, Mark


### Summary of Conversation:

We all agreed to do tasks to complete our sprint backlog, we considered the idea of embedding the questionnaire with a Microsoft form but it seemed too easy and as we asked Mike he said it would be better if we had a cool API to use with it.
So we ended up carrying on with our assigned tasks to make our own questionnaire based site.
