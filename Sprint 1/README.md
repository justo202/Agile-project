### Summary of Conversation:

We all agreed to do tasks to complete our sprint backlog, we considered the idea of embedding the questionnaire with a Microsoft form but it seemed too easy and as we asked Mike he said it would be better if we had a cool API to use with it.

We're all getting very close to completing our tasks so we're very close to the goals we set ourselves for the sprint backlog.
Dominic got the questionnaire up and running and Justas managed to make the extract button so that we get the answers from the questionnaire to a text file.
Vivien unfortonutaly ran into some issues with the login after some edits and had to go back to how it was because the index page wasn't displaying anymore.
Gerard and Justas helped Dominic as he ran into some issues when it came to viewing answers. 
Gerard also pretty much helped and reviewed most of the codes to make them fit.
